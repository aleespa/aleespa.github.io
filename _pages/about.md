Welcome to my blog! I'm Alejandro, and I created this space to share my journey through the world of mathematics, 
probability, and statistics. These posts are a collection of my notes and explorations from my time as an undergraduate
student studying Actuarial Sciences. Most of my posts are written in Spanish, but I also have a few posts in English.

While my professional work has since taken me into the world of quantitative finance, the foundational concepts I 
explored here continue to be the backbone of my work. This blog is a personal archive of that early passion for 
mathematical problem-solving and an informal look at the topics that laid the groundwork for my career.

Feel free to browse the posts and dive into the math with me.
